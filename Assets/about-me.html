          &emsp;Hi my name is Rodd. I am 36 years old, a lucky husband and a
          father to a wonderful little boy from the beautiful ever green
          Seattle, WA. I am currently a student at Arizona State University
          studying Software Engineering and planning to finish my Undergraduate
          degree. My biggest motivation to attend the coding bootcamp was to get
          into the field as soon as possible so by the time I finish my degree
          I'd already have some experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          &emsp;My current occupation is in the restaurant management field and
          really enjoy my job since not only it's extremely flexible but I get
          to go places and meet lots of great people everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;On my free time I enjoy playing Chess with my son in addition to
          reading (love history books) and hiking. cooking is also my passion
          even though my wife hates it when I cook. She believes I mess up the
          kitchen all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;I thrive for accomplishments and growth provides me pleasure and
          life gets too boring for me if it turns stagnant. willing to teach
          what I know and most important of all eager to learn what I lack
          knowledge of.
        </p>
